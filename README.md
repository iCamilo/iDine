> In this project I’ve tried to expose you to a number of different things all at once, including lists, stacks, forms, navigation, alerts, and more. But even though we’ve only built a simple app, I hope you can appreciate how powerful SwiftUI is, and how it makes it easy to build real-world projects quickly.

### Wrap up

- Building a menu using `List` and `ForEach`
- `ZStack` to place views one on top of the other
- List `Section`. Using `disabled()` to disable Sections. 
- `NavigationStack`, `navigationTitle()` and `toolbarTitleDisplayMode()`
- Polishing designs with fonts and colors
- Displaying a detail screen with `NavigationLink`
- `ObservableObject` and `@Published` to emit value changes to an object
- `@EnvironmentObject` to share and sync an object between multiple Views. 
- `TabView` and `tabItem()` to show multiple options in a tab manner. 
- Bindings and forms
- Two-way bindings in SwiftUI
- `alert(_:message:)` Presenting an alert
- `.formatted`  Formatting interpolated strings in SwiftUI- 
- `onDelete` Adding swipe to delete EditButton. `EditButton()` to edit multiple items on a list.
- `Picker` and `pickerStyle()` Adding different styles of pickers 
- `.toolbar` and `ToolbarItem(placement:)` to add items to the tool bar and place them.
- `.clipShape` and `.overlay` to shape a View 
- `Font+custom` extension: Adding and using custom fonts
